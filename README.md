* [How to run](front-end/README.md)
### Development Framework
React Framework - React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.
I choose a this framework because React allows to create a web app more fast, more scalable, and more simple. Also, I have used React framework as frontend on many projects.
Gatsby.js - Gatsby does the data sourcing and the fetches the files during the build time itself. I often use for speed and plugins, SEO.
